          Hey there! I'm Vaduni Niranjan â€” a Computer Science student at
          Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology (CGPA: 8.66), driven
          by the thrill of turning ideas into impactful digital experiences.
          Whether itâ€™s crafting sleek user interfaces, building full-stack web
          apps, or diving deep into cybersecurity, I thrive at the intersection
          of functionality and creativity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-7 text-gray-800 mt-4 text-justify">
          With a strong foundation in programming and a growing curiosity for
          new technologies, I enjoy building solutions that are both functional
          and impactful. From coding interactive tools and dynamic websites to
          designing visuals for the GeeksforGeeks GCET Graphics Team, I enjoy
          bringing both logic and aesthetics into every project. Iâ€™m constantly
          learning, experimenting, and exploring new tech â€” always looking for
          innovative ways to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
